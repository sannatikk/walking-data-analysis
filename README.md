# Walking Analytics: Accelerometer & GPS data
## Applied Physics in Software Development (2.5 ECTS), course final project

For my project, I went on a quick walk with Linear Acceleration and GPS tracking turned on in the Phyphox smartphone app. I analyzed accelerometer data to calculate step statistics based on both Fourier transformations and a lowpass filter, observed GPS and subsequent velocity accuracy, and visualized my route on an open-source map.
